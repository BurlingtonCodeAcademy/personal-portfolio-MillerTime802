      <p className="bio">
        I was born and rasied in Vermont. Graduated from Stowe high school and
        then wanted out. Spent one year in California before realizing I much
        preferred the energy and speed of the East. I decided to follow my
        teenage dream of becoming an actor. I decided to audtion for the
        American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City. I was accepted and
        propmtly moved to NYC. I fell in love. NYC was everything I wanted in my
        late teens and throughout my twenties. I lived in the city for fifteen
        years. I bartended all over the city throughout those fifteen years. One
        night while bartending a customer offered me a sales job at a company
        specializing in counter-surveillance work. I stuck with that company for
        four years before venturing out on my own. I opened GM Security Group in
        2003. We had a crazy client list including many celebrities, mercenary
        armies, foreign leaders, mobsters, several large NYC businesses and
        everything in between. I received an offer for the comapny in 2008 and
        decided it was time to sell. MORE TO COME.....
